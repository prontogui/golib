// Prepares all the primitives that will participate in the GUI.  This must be called at least once before Wait().
//
// Note:  it is possible to reuse primitive instance throughout the same GUI and even across multiple GUIs but there are
// some things to be aware of.
//
//   - If you change a field of a primitive that no longer is part of the active GUI then you could have indesirable behavior
//     or a panic situation.  This is because the primitive is still "prepped" for communication but has since been divorced
//     from the GUI model.  Right now, there is no compelling reason to "unprepare" primitives that no longer participte in
//     the GUI since this would have some impact on performance.  This could change as ProntoGUI usage evolves and perhaps
//     we might add a flexible policy in the future.  For now, don't do anything with non-participating primitives until
//     they're part of the active GUI again (by calling SetGUI).
//
//   - Updates to the primitive coming from the app side will not be discernable.  To explain this, let's say you have the
//     same Command primitive instance in three different views.  When the user clicks on the Command, you will receive
//     on update from the Wait() function that the command was clicked.  However, you be able to know which view it was
//     participating in when the click happened.
//
//   - Updates to the primitive coming from the server side will only affect one instance of the primitive on the app side.
//     For example, if you change the label of a Command primitive that is reused several times in the same GUI, only one of
//     them will visually change.
//
//   - It's best to avoid reusing primitives in the same GUI unless they are static, such as Text.
