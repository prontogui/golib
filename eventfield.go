// The EventField is used to capture an event condition happening on the App side.  For example,
// when the user clicks on a Command, we need to know on the server side the moment this happens
// during a Wait cycle.
//
// Unlike other field types, this field doesn't store a value per se, but tracks if a value has been
// injested during the current Wait cycle.  This information is only valid if the Issued() method is
// called during the current Wait cycle.  If another Wait cycle is entered and no value is injested
// by this field, then it will no longer report Issued() = true.
//
// The field type solved a nagging problem when dealing with handling events on the service side,
// especially when Command primitivess are clicked/issued.  The Command doesn't have any state
// that changes like a Check or TextField might have, and the information it produces is momentary
// in nature.
//
// This field requires initialization after creation by setting its TimestampProvider member.  The
// timestamp provider supplies a time value that originates from the time package and uniquely
// represents the current Wait cycle.  A good implementation will keep a central timestamp generated
// from time.Now(), called at the beginning of each Wait cycle, and a central function for returning
// the timestamp.  The central function is assigned to every EventField during construction.
//
// We avoided creating a global timestamp in this module because in the future there could be multiple, concurrent
// Wait cycles going on.  It is also fragile to write unit tests this way.
